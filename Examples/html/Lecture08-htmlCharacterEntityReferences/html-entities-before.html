            &quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how
            the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have
            done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually
            who strive valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again,
            does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great
            enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy
            cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumpth of high
            achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while
            daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those
            cold and timid souls who neither know victory&nbsp;nor&nbsp;defeat.&quot;
