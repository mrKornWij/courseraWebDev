                in html, we use to display an image on the website:
                    1. "src" attribute is a url that points to some image files.
                        it should be relative path or url. If it comes only an image name.
                        the web browser will look for an image which is in the same directory
                        as the html file.
                    2."width", "height" are the size of image (pixels) which will show on the website.
                    3. "alt" attribute is used by screen readers. it helps people with visual impairment

            &quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man
            stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to 
            the man who is actually in the arena, whose face in marred by dust and sweat and blood;
            who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no
            effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who
            knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who 
            at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he 
            fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold
            and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&quot;
