        <p>
            Inheritence allows us to write more global styles on parent elements and then 
            "fine-tune" the styles for some of the child elements as needed. Such approach 
            makes writing CSS very efficient.

        <!-- We apply style Inline to this second <h2> so it will be in the case of Origin Precedence.
            this cause a conflict in "color". This style is applied after other declaration, so the 
            browser will show this <h2> as green-->
        <h2 style="color: green;">Subheading 2</h2>
