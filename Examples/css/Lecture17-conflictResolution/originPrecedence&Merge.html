        <!--This 1st <p>:
            1. there is conflict because there is a text color declaration in a stylesheet.
                So the browser will show text color in color 'maroon' because 'color: maroon;' is declared 
                after 'color: white;' declaration in a stylesheet.
            2. In a stylesheet also declare 'font-size: 130%;' and 'background-color: gray;'. 
            These styles have no conflict, so they will be merged and show on the browser
            3.so this paragraph will be shown the maroon text with gray background and 130% font size
        -->
        <p>The rule is simple: Last declaration wins.</p>

        <!--this 2nd <p> has conflict with "color" declation
            1.there is 'color: maroon;' from above and this 2nd <p> has Inline styling declaration 'color: black;'. 
            2.'color: black;' comes after 'color: maroon;', so the text color of this 2nd <p> will be black.
            3.'font-size: 130%;','background-color: gray;' from stylesheet have no conflict, so these style will be merged.
            4. this paragraph will be shown the black text with gray background and 130% font size.***

        <p style="color: black;">
            If there is no conflict, declarations merge into one rule.
